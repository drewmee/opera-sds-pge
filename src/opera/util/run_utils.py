    """
    Forms the appropriate command line for executing a SAS from the parameters
    obtained from the RunConfig.

    By default, this function assumes the SAS program path corresponds to an
    executable file reaching within the current environment's PATH. If this
    function cannot locate the executable, the SAS program path is assumed to be
    a Python module path and treated accordingly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sas_program_path : str
        The path to the SAS executable to be invoked by the returned command line.
    sas_runconfig_path : str
        The path to the RunConfig to feed to the SAS executable in the returned
        command line.
    sas_program_options : list[str], optional
        List of options to include in the returned command line.

    Returns
    -------
    command_line : list[str]
        The fully formed command line, returned in list format suitable for use
        with subprocess.run.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError

        set with execute permissions for the current process.

    Executes the provided command line via subprocess while collecting the

    ----------
    command_line : Iterable[str]

        A logger object used to capture any error status returned from execution.
